# AwakeningCircle

**{ interactive visionary installation } produced by [vulkai studio](http://www.vulkai.com) for [O.Z.O.R.A. festival](http://www.ozorafestival.eu)**

The installation is reflecting our inner connections with the universe â€” oneness. The inspiration came from the experience of spiritual awakening. The creative outcome of that are 6 real-sized human sculptures (semi-transparent bodies) gathered in a circle. Fluroscent Visionary Paintings on the outside off the sculptures and The LED strips from inside will highlight and visually express the awakening of each chakra in different body. The seventh position in the circle is open for the audience (one person at a time) to join the awakening. With the Kinect we will track people around the installation and trigger different light changes.
